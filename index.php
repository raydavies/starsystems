	<h4>A Four Step Approach to Learning</h4>
	<p><span>Study</span> Interactive lessons are your child's first step toward mastering the curriculum and improving in school. Use the study mode for homework help any time, day or night.<br><br>
	<span>Practice</span> Just like with a 'live' teacher, your child is given instant feedback. Get hands-on with the same material needed for school and standardized tests.<br><br>
	<span>Test</span> Prepare your child <strong><em>before</em></strong> she takes the test in school! Grades are written to the Progress Report for you to review.<br><br>
	<span>Essay</span> Help develop writing ability and research skills while your student exercises his creativity.</p>

	<h4>One-On-One Interaction</h4>
	<p> Owning the Interactive Curriculum Program is like having a full-time teacher working with your child! The program uses a combination of graphics, audio, and animation to <strong>make schoolwork fun and easy</strong>. The interactive lessons engage and guide your child while dynamic quizzes and a variety of writing exercises reinforce what she is learning.</p>
