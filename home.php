		<h4>A Four Step Approach to Learning</h4>
		<p>
			<span>Study</span> Interactive lessons are your child's first step toward mastering the curriculum and improving in school. Use the study mode for homework help any time, day or night.<br><br>
			<span>Practice</span> Just like with a 'live' teacher, your child is given instant feedback. Get hands-on with the same material needed for school and standardized tests.<br><br>
			<span>Test</span> Prepare your child <strong><em>before</em></strong> she takes the test in school! Grades are written to the Progress Report for you to review.<br><br>
			<span>Essay</span> Help develop writing ability and research skills while your student exercises his creativity.
