At Star we believe that the best solution is for families to own the curriculum, to have it at home for children to use.

Towards that end, we bring you the Interactive Curriculum Encyclopedia, a comprehensive program designed especially for home use. The Interactive Curriculum will teach your child the specific topics he or she is expected to learn at each grade level in order to achieve academic success.

Bringing the schoolwork into your home is a decision that you will look back on in future years with great pride and satisfaction. Only by taking control of your childï¿½s education can you be sure that your child will Know It All!
